# üñ•Ô∏è Java Bytecode Interpreter

## Descriptionü§ó

This project is a Java-based interpreter for a custom programming language. The interpreter is designed to load, execute, and interpret bytecode instructions. The system consists of several classes that work together to provide a functional and efficient bytecode interpreter.

## Featuresüôå

- **Bytecode Loading:**
  - Reads and parses bytecode files.
  - Validates bytecode syntax and structure.

- **Execution Engine:**
  - Executes bytecode instructions.
  - Supports various operations like arithmetic, control flow, and memory manipulation.

- **Interpreter:**
  - Interprets bytecode instructions and manages execution state.
  - Handles variables, functions, and error reporting.

## Getting Startedüê¢

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have JDK version 16 or later installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** This IDE is recommended for building and running the project. You can download it from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjestrada2/java-bytecode-interpreter.git
    cd java-bytecode-interpreter
    ```

2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA:**

    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Click the "Open" button in the top right corner.
    - Choose the folder named "java-bytecode-interpreter" from the cloned repository.

3. **Configure Project Settings:**

    - Open the "Project Structure" window using `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`.
    - In "SDK and Language Version," select a Java version that's at least Java 16.
    - In "Project Settings," choose "Modules" and mark the "resources" folder as Resources.

4. **Build the Project:**

    - Click the "Build" button at the top of the IDE (`CTRL+F9`).

### Running the Interpreter

1. **Run the Interpreter via IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Hit the play button in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - OR right-click `Main.java` and select `RUN`.

2. **Run the Interpreter from Command Line:**
   - Build the project to create a JAR file.
   - Open a console located in the same directory as the JAR and type:

     ```bash
     java -jar java-bytecode-interpreter.jar <path-to-bytecode-file>
     ```
